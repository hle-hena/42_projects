Change draw map so it draws from back to front, and not always from top to bot.
I am 90 % sure there is no floating point error left. But it will need some checking

fix the rotation in perspective so rotating around the y axis doesnt change the others.

Please I swear to god make opti !
->Create a func create_line which will create the line and give the color to each point based on the grid created at init. When calling draw_line, calling it on two points then.
->if a precedent line couldnt be drawn, just dont even ask for the next one and just qui already man
->the far plane should be an option, not a default
->
```
if (far.left is not in screen)
	dont't go down to the camera, and go directly to the next one.
	//same for the right ?
```

Scale is affecting the perspective proj //Might just not allow to scale I think
Fix the gradient
Make the zoom with the center at mouse pos

Rotate with mouse
