I need to :
	Rotate the camera base
	Rotate the world base by -the angle ?
	Move the camera based on the camera base
	Calculate points base on the world base
	What about the view z placement ?
	What about the color ?

Block the rotation so it is logic (for ex, in x and y, only able to go like 0 to 180 deg)

Fix the size of the window. It is fucked up.

Change draw map so it draws from back to front, and not always from top to bot.
Scale is affecting the gradient and breaking it if too zoomed in.

Fix the Makefile. It relinks I think

Add the color to the parsing
Fix the length issue at the read of the map.
Accept maps with new line at the end.

Re implement the near plane. Went missing because it was poorly done and interacted with the automatic color
Fix the movement. The camera display is weird.
Make the zoom with the center at mouse pos
Rotate with mouse

Add the new perspective.
Add suppoert for multiple maps

Fix the gradient
