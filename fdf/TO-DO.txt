Change draw map so it draws from back to front, and not always from top to bot.
I am 90 % sure there is no floating point error left. But it will need some checking

Please I swear to god make opti !
->the far plane should be an option, not a default
->if a precedent line couldnt be drawn, just dont even ask for the next one and just quit already man
->
```
if (far.left is not in screen)
	dont't go down to the camera, and go directly to the next one.
	//same for the right ?
```

Fix the gradient
Make the zoom with the center at mouse pos //We don't actually care, it scales base on origin so it is not so strange

Rotate with mouse

Add a menu
Add support for multiple maps
