Please I swear to god make opti !
->the far plane should be an option, not a default
->if a precedent line couldnt be drawn, just dont even ask for the next one and just quit already man
->
```
if (far.left is not in screen)
	dont't go down to the camera, and go directly to the next one.
	//same for the right ?
```

For the fps idea :
- When first loading the map, record the fps, and then always set this to the desired speed. The faster it has been loaded the first time, the smaller that speed should be.
